    <h2>About Me - Lihle Naphakade</h2>
    <p>My name is Lihle Naphakade, I was born on the 24-Oct-1995. I studied Business Management at Boland college, I also completed two short courses at the North-West University in Behavioural and Organisational Skills and Workplace Relations. If you click on my CV ,you will get full insight regarding my qualifications.</p>
    <p>Allow me to tell you a little bit about me. Fistly, I call this portfolio a "Work in Progress" because I am still to grow more as a programmer and in all aspects of my life.</p>

    <p>I am a hard-working and organized person who possesses a high standard of numeracy skills. I enjoy problem solving and I am readily willing to learn new skills. I am an excellent team player who is able to work with people from all backgrounds. I thrive when working within a pressurized environment and am readily willing to learn and develop my skills and personal qualities.</p>

    <p>I have been involved in many extra mural activities aimed at developing my confidence, verbal communication and team working skills. Whilst at college I have been heavily involved in my Church through my Youth Group. Being a part of these group has had a great impact in my life and has helped me make wise decisions and realize the potential I have to ensure my dreams become a reality. The youth today are exposed to a lot of things good and bad, but by committing myself to this group I have expanded my horizons and am determined to create a successful life which I can be proud of.</ p>
